# In Game History
___One day while harvesting his farm, John, stumbled and fell into a hole. When he woke up, he realized he was in a dungeon. Suddenly he saw a huge monster that looked like a blob of darkness in the shape of a man. Suddenly John realized that there was an emptiness in his chest. The monster replied that if John defeated all the monsters he would get his heart back and go back to his normal life, but if John lost, the monster would take his soul he would disappear forever.___
